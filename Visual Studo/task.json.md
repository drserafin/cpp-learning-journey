## What is tasks.json do in Visuatl Studio Code?

In the simplest terms, `task.json` in Visual Studeio Code is a configuration file that defines automated commands or tasks you want to run, like compiling code or running tests.

<b> Think of it like: </b>
* Purpose: It tells VS code what commands to run and who to run them.
* Use Case: You can use it to automate repetitive tasks like building your code, cleaning up files, or running scrips.
* Content: It contains instructions and settings that describe how to execute these taks.

For example, if you want to compile a C++ program, you can define a task in `tasks.json` to use `g++` with specific options, so you don't have to type the command manually each time.
