## What does `this->` mean in C++

`this` is a pointer that points to the current object of the class. It allows you to acess the member variables and function of the object of the class. `this` is a special poitner available inside non-static member functions of a class. It points to the object for which the member function was called. Essential,`this` is a poitner to the current instance of the class.

Using `this->` makes it clear that you are working with the class's member variable, ensuring that your modifying the specific instance's `value`, rather than any local or parameter variable with the same name.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int value;

    // Constructor to initialize the member variable
    Example(int value) {
        this->value = value; // Sets the member variable 'value' to the constructor parameter 'value'
    }

    // Method to update the member variable
    void setValue(int value) {
        this->value = value; // Sets the member variable 'value' to the method parameter 'value'
    }
};
