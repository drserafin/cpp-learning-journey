## C++ Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++ , there are different types of variable:

* `int` - stores integers
* `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
* `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'b'
* `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World"
* `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false
