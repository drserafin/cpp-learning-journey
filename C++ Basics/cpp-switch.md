# C++ Switch Statements

Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Example:

```cpp

int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    cout << "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    cout << "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    cout << "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    cout << "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    cout << "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    cout << "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    cout << "Sunday";
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)

``````

When C++ reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
