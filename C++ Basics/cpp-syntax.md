When we are coding in C++, we typically save our files with the .cpp file extension. This allows our computer and development tools to recognize that the file contains C++ source code.

For example, we can name a file helloworld.cpp.

Inside this helloworld.cpp file, we can include the following source code that will output "Hello World":
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
