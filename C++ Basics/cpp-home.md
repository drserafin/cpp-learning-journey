C++ is a popular programming language widely used to create computer programs, and it is one of the most commonly used languages in game development. It was developed as an extension of C, and both languages share almost the same syntax. C++ allows programmers to have a high level of control over system resources and memory. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup**.
