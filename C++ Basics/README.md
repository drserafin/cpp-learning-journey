## C++ Home

Welcome to the C++ Basics repository! This repository contains examples and explanations for learning C++ programming.

## C++ Intro

### What is C++?

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language used for a wide variety of applications, including system/software development, game development, and more.

- C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
- C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the C language.
- C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
- The language was updated with major releases such as C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.

## C++ Get Started

### Example 1: Hello World

For more details, see [Main.cpp README](Main_README.md).

## C++ Syntax

### Example 2: Functions and Classes

For more details, see [Other.cpp README](Other_README.md).

## C++ Output

### Example 3: Output using cout

```cpp
// Output.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
