## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

For learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, please refer to the [OOP folder](OOP/README.md).

# C++ Get Started

To start using C++, you need two things:
* A text editor to write C++ code
* A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand

With this in mind, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is often used to edit and compile the code. Popular IDEs include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.

Replit is also an amazing online IDE that supports various programming languages.

You can also use the following online compilers to run code:
